description: Turn an idea into a design through collaborative dialogue
---

Use the **brainstormer** agent workflow to turn the user's idea into a design.

## Process

1. Check project context (files, docs, recent commits if available)
2. Ask clarifying questions ONE AT A TIME (prefer multiple choice)
3. Propose 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
4. Present design in 200-300 word sections, validating each
5. Write final design to `thoughts/shared/designs/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md`

The user's idea follows. Turn it into a design ready for `/research`.
